Stereogram Genius is a mobile application developed using Expo and React Native, allowing users to create and share stereograms with hidden text. Additionally, the app includes functionality to generate random stereograms.

## Features

- Create custom stereograms with hidden text.
- Generate random stereograms for a fun surprise.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.
- Compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js, npm/yarn, and Expo CLI installed on your machine. If you plan to demo this on your machine, you'll need either Android Studio and/or Xcode installed as well. To demo this on your phone, download the Expo Go app from the App Store or Google Play Store.

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

`git clone git@github.com:camjohnson-code/stereogram-genius.git`


Install the required packages:

`npm install`


Start the development server:

`npm start`


Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo Dev Tools with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to open the app on your phone.

To open up the app on your machine:

`i` will open the app in Xcode Simulator

`a` will open the app in Android Studio

## Future Improvements

In the future, we'd like to add the following features:

- Modify end result to allow for colors
- Allow users to further customize their stereogram by selecting from an assortment of patterns instead of the default static
- Implement a feature that allows users to submit their own images to be used instead of text/words
